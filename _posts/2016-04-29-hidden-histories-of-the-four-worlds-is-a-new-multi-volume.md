Volume 1: The Price of Defiance

These are the Things Which are Known: 

* That at the End, the Fourth World has become the Last World.
* That Ngzurrek NightMother and Zoae BrightDaughter are the protectors of the Derrichai.
* That Iern MadGod roused his Son Ngorrl to Burn the Last World.
* That all Prophets are Deceivers, and all Seers Blind.
* That the Derrichai are Free and shall not be Slaves to false Destinies.
* That at the End, the Baen Gar shall Rise, and the Lord of the Fourth World will Fall.

This is not a Prophecy of the Derrichai. It is the Promise of the Derrichai.

In the End there is Only the Truth.

It is the Stone on which we Stand.

from, _The Derrichai Creed_

At the heart of the Northern Domains, the crooked towers of Nefwirphanx rise out of the mists like the Sleeping God rising from his place of rest. This is the seat of power for the Derrichai: a people ruled by brutal Warthanes who worship gods of Madness, Love, and Eternal Night. Locked in struggles that seemingly have no end--a war with the southern kingdoms who proclaim that there is only One God--constant plotting by competing lords of the domains--uprisings from the enslaved Mammakdur--this Empire without an Emperor tilts between the powers that seek to rule it, and those who would destroy it.

Trying to find his own place in this hostile world is young Tabyr. The children of temple courtesans, Tabyr and his friends belong to a class that those striving for power in the shadowy halls of Nefwirphanx would prefer to forget. But Tabyr's chance meeting with the powerful and inscrutable homunculus, Krewgkyrie, sends him on a winding journey through the passages of The Crooked Palace, passages that Tabyr soon discovers twist through time as well as space. Along the way, he and his friends will uncover secrets that were meant to lie buried, and in seeking the truths of their own hidden histories, inevitably find that there is a price to pay for defying the powerful.

A fable told on an epic scale, The Price of Defiance invites the reader to embark on a journey in which light and shadow are not always simple proxies for good and evil. Set in a chiaroscuro world amid a people striving to discover, or become, the next Baen Gar--The Lord of Night--readers will navigate a unique land, in which the unformed future seeks to rewrite an unstable past, where the familiar is transformed into the unexpected, and where the races of four worlds struggle to discover the destiny that awaits them at the End of the Last World.
